1. **Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.**  
- The problem I'm trying to solve with this app is a language barrier problem. Swahili is widely spoken language in East Africa. Recently, East Africa has been attracting a lot of foreigners in terms of tourism and business. This is where my app comes into play, it would be useful for these foreigners to have a Swahili translator while they go about their business.  
2. **Why is it a problem that needs solving?**  
- It is a problem that needs solving because there would be no proper way for people to connect with a language barrier in place. People understand each other better if there is good communication. Solving the problem would bring along a lot of benefits such as, better communication, efficient business dealings and better connections between people.
